# Examples

This is a set of working examples for use with the included runner, `run.py`.

The idea is to provide something easily executed, that can be tinkered with â€“ for new users
to get an idea of how the library works.

Simply clone this repo, modify the `run.py` script as needed and execute from the project root, e.g.:

```bash
$ python3 examples/run.py table.read.nested
```
